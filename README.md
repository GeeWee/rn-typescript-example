# RN + Typescript

This is a minimal example of using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), and [Haul](https://github.com/callstack-io/haul) to build an iOS app.

## Work in progress

Things that don't work:

- Source maps
- Tapping errors in the simulator and seeing them in an editor (VScode)
- Type information from react native (and react)

## Trying it out!

- `git clone git@github.com:nixterrimus/rn-typescript-example.git`
- `yarn install`
- `yarn run haul start -- --platform ios`
